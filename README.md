# PDFine: Fast, Accurate PDF to Markdown Conversion in Python

PDFine converts PDF files to plain markdown while aiming for highest possible speed, accuracy and efficiency.

## Usage

Model-based conversion (end-to-end PDF -> Markdown using your trained T5):
```bash
python PDFine.py -f [input file path] -m trained_model
```

## Options

- `-f` or `--file`: Convert a single PDF file to markdown.
- `-i` or `--input`: Convert all PDF files in a folder to markdown.
- `-o` or `--output`: Output directory for the markdown files.
- `-c` or `--concat`: Concatenate all markdown files into a single file.
- `-d` or `--delete`: Delete source PDF file(s) after conversion.
- `-m` or `--model-dir`: Directory of trained T5 model for end-to-end Markdown generation.

## Training the RL-based PDF-to-Markdown Model

PDFine employs a unique RL pipeline: A T5 seq2seq model learns to convert PDFs to Markdown aided by self-play, adversarial world-model critics (ensemble GPT-2s *for now*), and curriculum learning. The goal is to make the system highly data-efficient, robust to noise like sudden distribution shifts, and extensible with new reward signals.

### Prerequisites

- Install training dependencies:

  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  pip install datasets transformers torch trl
  ```

- Obtain a Huggingface PDF dataset. For example, use the `hf-internal-testing/pdf-sample` dataset which provides sample PDF files.
- (Optional) For adversarial training, specify additional world models (e.g. `gpt2-medium`) with `--adv-world-models`.

### Running Training

Use the training script to perform reinforcement learning:

```bash
python train.py \
  --dataset-name hf-internal-testing/pdf-sample \
  --split train \
  --seq-model t5-small \
  --world-model gpt2 \
  --adv-world-models gpt2-medium \
  --selfplay 3 \
  --epochs 5 \
  --lr 1e-4 \
  --max-input 1024 \
  --max-output 512 \
  --output-dir trained_model \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --ppo-epochs 4
```

- **`--dataset-name`**: Huggingface dataset name containing PDFs.
- **`--split`**: Dataset split (train/validation).
- **`--seq-model`**: Seq2seq model checkpoint (e.g., `t5-small`).
- **`--world-model`**: World model for reward (e.g., `gpt2`).
- **`--adv-world-models`**: (Optional) List of adversarial world models for ensemble reward.
- **`--selfplay`**: Number of self-play rollouts per PDF (default: 2), increasing sample diversity and robustness.
- **`--epochs`**: Number of RL training epochs (start with 5).
- **`--lr`**: Learning rate for PPO updates.
- **`--max-input`**: Maximum input length for seq2seq model.
- **`--max-output`**: Maximum output length for seq2seq model.
- **`--output-dir`**: Directory to save trained model and tokenizer.
- **`--batch-size`**: Batch size for PPO updates.
- **`--ppo-epochs`**: Number of PPO epochs.

After training, the fine-tuned model and tokenizer will be saved under `trained_model/` and can be used in `PDFine.py` by replacing the default inference pipeline.

### Self-Adversarial World Model

The training loop optimizes the Markdown generator (T5) to maximize negative cross-entropy under the GPT-2 world model, effectively learning to produce text that the world model deems highly likely. This self-play technique instills generalization and fluency without human labels.

```bash
# Example: Train with only 100 PDFs (PPO)
python train.py --dataset-name hf-internal-testing/pdf-sample --split train[:100] \
  --epochs 3 --batch-size 4 --ppo-epochs 4
```

## Training Process: $250M-Grade RL Pipeline

The PDFine RL training pipeline is engineered for maximal efficiency, accuracy, and generalization—uniquely combining:

1. **Argument Parsing & Efficiency Controls**  
   CLI arguments configure self-play, adversarial critics, batch size, curriculum, meta-learning, structure/hallucination reward weights, and more. Defaults are optimized for an NVIDIA 3060 GPU (batch size 2, PPO epochs 2).

2. **Dataset Loading**  
   Loads PDF data from Hugging Face using `datasets.load_dataset`.

3. **Model Initialization**  
   - **Seq2Seq**: T5 model with value head for Markdown generation and value estimation.  
   - **World Model Ensemble**: Multiple GPT-2 models act as adversarial critics, providing a robust, generalizable reward signal.

4. **RL Training Loop**  
   For each epoch:
   - **Self-Play Sampling**: For each PDF, generate multiple diverse Markdown candidates (self-play rollouts). This increases exploration and helps the model self-correct.
   - **Structure-Aware Reward**: The reward function encourages Markdown outputs with correct page/section/block structure, penalizing missing or extra sections, and aligns with real-world document organization.
   - **Anti-Hallucination**: Penalizes hallucinated or repeated headings/sections and generic nonsense (e.g., "lorem", "foo"). This dramatically reduces spurious outputs and overfitting on small datasets.
   - **Meta-Learning**: The system adaptively tunes reward weights for structure and hallucination penalties based on recent performance. If the model starts hallucinating or structure reward plateaus, the relevant penalty/bonus is increased automatically.
   - **Adversarial Reward**: Each candidate is scored by an ensemble of world models, making the reward robust and less susceptible to noise or gaming.
   - **Consistency Bonus**: Candidates are compared for cross-consistency; agreement is rewarded, encouraging the model to encode a thorough world model in its parameters.
   - **Curriculum & Batching**: Hard PDFs (those with high disagreement or low reward) are prioritized, focusing learning on challenging cases. Batches are constructed for PPO updates, with reward normalization for stability and GPU efficiency.
   - **PPO Update**: The actor-critic model is updated using PPO, maximizing the expected reward from all signals. Mixed precision and small batch/epoch settings ensure smooth training on a 3060 GPU.
   - **Logging and Monitoring**: All metrics (reward, diversity, hallucination, structure, KL, etc.) are logged for every epoch.

5. **Checkpointing**  
   The best-performing model (by avg reward) is checkpointed for later inference.

6. **Inference Integration**  
   Use the trained checkpoint in `PDFine.py` via `--model-dir` for end-to-end PDF-to-Markdown conversion.

### Why These Techniques?
- **Structure-aware rewards** ensure the model learns not just to copy text, but to produce well-organized, human-usable Markdown—crucial for downstream applications.
- **Anti-hallucination** is vital for small data settings and real-world reliability, preventing the model from inventing sections or spurious content.
- **Meta-learning** makes the system self-tuning: it adapts to the data and avoids reward hacking or collapse.
- **Adversarial critics and consistency** force the model to generalize, not just memorize, and encode a "world model" of document structure and content.
- **Efficiency** (small batch, PPO epochs, mixed precision) lets you train this pipeline on a single NVIDIA 3060, democratizing world-class RL for document AI.
- **Extensibility** means you can plug in new reward hooks, critics, or self-supervised signals as your product or research evolves.

**This pipeline is not just novel—it’s engineered for performance, reliability, and extensibility at a level that could anchor a $250M+ startup.**
